# NLP_English_French_Translation
Built a word-alignment model, using the IBM-1 model, to translate French sentences into English.
Used uni and bigram models, with add-Î´ discounting.
The data was trained on the Canadian Hansard data, which consists of official records (Hansards) of the 36th Canadian Parliament, including debates from both the House of Representatives and the Senate, in English and French.
